/**
 * First-run onboarding as this window runs it: one chat in the default profile, opened by the
 * backend's `onboarding.start`, ended by the answer to the first-task card or by Skip setup.
 *
 * This module is the one writer of `$onboardingPhase` and of the `onboarding` presence surface. The
 * surface is open while a run is starting or its chat is on screen; in any other chat the app behaves
 * as it does outside onboarding (tips, the sign-in offer). The backend owns whether onboarding is due
 * (`onboarding.state`) and writes the install-level flag when a run ends.
